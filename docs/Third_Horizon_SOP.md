# Third Horizon Standard Operating Procedures

**2026 Planning Workbook**

---

## About This Document

This Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Workbook defines how Third Horizon operates as an organization. It documents every major process and function, assigns clear accountability, and establishes the governance framework that keeps the company aligned and effective.

### Purpose

- **Clarity**: Ensure every team member knows who owns what and how work flows through the organization
- **Accountability**: Establish clear ownership using the RACI framework so nothing falls through the cracks
- **Consistency**: Create repeatable processes that deliver reliable outcomes
- **Scalability**: Build operational infrastructure that supports growth without chaos

### How to Use This Document

1. **Find your role** in the organizational structure to understand your responsibilities
2. **Reference specific processes** when questions arise about how work should flow
3. **Use RACI matrices** to understand your involvement level in each process
4. **Escalate appropriately** using the defined pathways when issues arise

---

## Key Concepts

### Processes vs. Functions

This document distinguishes between two types of operational work:

| Type | Definition | Characteristics | Examples |
|------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Processes** | Recurring operational workflows with defined steps | Sequential, repeatable, measurable | Accounts Receivable, Employee Onboarding, Contract Closure |
| **Functions** | Ongoing governance and strategic responsibilities | Continuous, judgment-based, oversight-oriented | Strategic Planning, Quality Assurance, Risk Management |

**Naming Convention**:
- Processes use short codes: `[AR]`, `[BD]`, `[SD]`
- Functions use `F-` prefix: `[F-EOC]`, `[F-SP]`, `[F-CAI]`

### The RACI Framework

Every process and function uses RACI to clarify roles:

| Letter | Role | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| **R** | Responsible | Does the work; executes the task |
| **A** | Accountable | Owns the outcome; has final authority; only ONE person per task |
| **C** | Contributor | Provides input, expertise, or resources |
| **I** | Informed | Kept in the loop; receives updates |

**Key Principles**:
- Every task has exactly ONE Accountable person
- Accountable ≠ Responsible (the owner doesn't always do the work)
- Contributors are actively involved; Informed parties just receive updates

### CSOG (C-Suite Operating Group)

References to "CSOG" throughout this document refer to the executive leadership team collectively: CEO, President, COO, CFO, CDAO, CGO, and CSO meeting as a group.

## Organizational Structure

Third Horizon operates with seven executive roles, each accountable for specific domains:

| Role | Executive | Domain | Focus Area |
